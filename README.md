Company Bankruptcy Prediction

We have seen in the past that a single organization in loss candrag the entire market down with it. It is important to evaluate thefinancial health of a company before investment. A lot of factorsgo into determining the overall status of an organization. With theadvent of big data and machine learning, it has become increasinglyeasy to predict the likelihood of a company going into bankruptcy.

In the aforementioned dataset, we have 95 different financialratios that could predict bankruptcy. We will investigate whichof the features have the biggest impact to predict bankruptcy. Toachieve this objective, we will be performing feature engineering tofind a smaller subset of the given ratios. Dimensionality reductionwill help us reduce the classification model complexity by a largemargin. Later, we will build a random forest classifier to get thebankruptcy prediction
